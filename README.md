- Product name and a one-sentence description: Wildlife Next Step is a prototype that helps someone who finds a wild animal understand the safest next step, including what to do when it is after normal rehabilitator hours.

- The first working slice allows a user to enter a fictional animal situation. The simulated AI extracts details and asks follow-up questions, then the user receives one of three paths: leave it alone and observe, contact a rehabilitator, or view an after-hours plan.
  
- Prototype link: https://wildlife-next-step.replit.app/
  
- AI behavior is currently simulated. The prototype uses preset follow-up questions and rule-based results rather than a live AI model.

- What the future AI system is intended to do: In a future version, AI would read a user’s description of a wildlife situation, extract important details, and ask follow-up questions in plain language. It would help organize the information before the app uses expert-reviewed rules to select a path.

- What currently works: Users can enter a fictional wildlife situation, answer questions, and receive a visible result: leave it alone and observe, contact a rehabilitator, or view an after-hours plan. The app also simulates Indiana DNR rehabilitator information.

- What is simulated: The AI behavior is simulated with preset follow-up questions and rule-based recommendations. The app does not currently use a live AI model to understand the user’s own written description.

- Test results:
| Test | Input or Action | What Happened | Pass, Partial, or Fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Typical Case | Entered a healthy-looking juvenile squirrel that was moving normally and showed no visible injury, unknown if the parent was nearby, and daytime. | The app asks any needed follow-up questions and gives the “Leave it alone and observe” path. It explains why and does not give animal-care instructions. | Pass because this is a situation that has not yet caused concern. |
| Challenge Case | Entered an animal with visible bleeding at night, after the listed rehabilitator’s normal hours. | The app recognized the report of visible bleeding after normal hours and showed an Urgent After-Hours Plan. It provided the simulated rehabilitator’s phone number and message option, directed the user to check verified alternate or 24-hour veterinary contacts, and explained that the app could not determine whether waiting was safe or provide treatment instructions. | Passed because it showed the after-hours process safely by highlighting the Indiana rehabilitation guidelines. |
| Invalid or Empty Case | I tried submitting the form without entering an animal type, injury information, or enough details to come to a conclusion. | I entered “unknown” for every question, but the app still recommended contacting a wildlife rehabilitator. It did not recognize that there was not enough information to provide a supported recommendation. | Failed because despite putting in unknown for every answer, the final recommendation was to contact a wildlife rehabilitator instead of coming up with an error message asking for more information. |

- Known limitations:

1. The AI behavior is still simulated. The prototype uses preset follow-up questions and rule-based recommendations instead of a live AI model that can understand a user’s written description.

2. The error handling needs improvement. During testing, entering “unknown” for every question still produced a recommendation to contact a wildlife rehabilitator instead of asking the user for more information. The next version should block unsupported recommendations and highlight missing answers.

3. The prototype does not save a user’s progress or past results. If a user refreshes the page or leaves the app, they must start the wildlife scenario again. A later version could save a practice session or let a teacher review completed scenarios.
